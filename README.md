# boston-typescript-june-2019-talk
a short talk about avoiding testing implementation details in a react project.

### setup
Presentation is an MDX deck in the `slides/` directory. Once in the directory run `npm install` then `npm start` to run an instance of the slide deck in your local browser.

The `rtl-jest-example/` is a small bar graph written in D3 and TypeScript to showcase how to write tests using `@testing-library/react`. To run this example, while in the `rtl-jest-example/` directory run the command `npm install` then `npm test`. This will install all the dependencies and run a basic integration test.
